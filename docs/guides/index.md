# Getting Started

Welcome to the VueVentus design system component docs!

You'll find lots of information and insight here covering how to use the VueVentus data flows in the contexts of Vue.js, to end the era of massive atomic class strings.

But first, you'll need to choose your path for installation:

* [Vite Install](/guides/install-vite)
* [Vue CLI Install](/guides/install-vue-cli)
* [VILT Stack Install](/guides/install-vilt)


::: warning 
VueVentus is not currently written with Typescript. There are some components like VueVentus's `VvEl` and `VvConfig` that were written in Typescript, but some pesky bugs pushed this project back into normal Vue 3 SFCs and the composition API to move forward. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
