# Config Modules

Config Modules keep reusable and customizable groups of non-color orientated Tailwind CSS classes for use in element, component, and layout levels of an application.

::: info ABOUT CONFIG MODULES
Config Modules are like the Tailwind CSS `@apply` directive, but are instead managed outside of the CSS scope. Config Modules rely on the Tailwind purge process, which allows JavaScript and JSON atomic classes data to be used throughout the JavaScript stack in a fully DRY way.
