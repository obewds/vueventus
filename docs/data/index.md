# {{ $frontmatter.title }}

VueVentus uses {{ $frontmatter.title }} to store various raw data settings that are in-turn parsed and used by Tailwind CSS's engine to determine the syntax you'll use in your app's atomic classes.

There are currently three main types of {{ $frontmatter.title }} to use in your app's Tailwind CSS config file:

* [Theme Extenders]()
* [Theme Additions]()
* [App Color Configs]()
