# {{ $frontmatter.title }}

The {{ $frontmatter.title }} is the backbone of VueVentus in a prototypal sense. However, it should and will also be used as a blueprint to define your app's brand and color palettes at the global level, to keep Tailwind CSS classes in a thourough and design sensitive way - with contextual colors ALWAYS abstracted into named palettes and named colors as properties of those named palettes.
