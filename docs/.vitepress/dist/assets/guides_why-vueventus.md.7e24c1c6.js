It is designed to weave the advantages of Tailwind CSS into the natural flow and Developer Experience (DX) of modern app development.</p><p>This position and these abstractions provide modular and component focused management of the many different types of repeated strings and even JavaScript primitives that occur in everyday app development. <em><strong>(Not stateful JavaScript primitives... but static global data... is super easy to add in a pinch!).</strong></em> \u{1F99E}</p><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">TIP</p><p>VueVentus is highly opinionated from a programmatic POV. But from a design POV, VueVentus is intensely customizable and powerful, because it uses obsessively DRY programmatic approaches under the hood.</p><p>Then from that point, the system provides basic getters to allow devs to reach into the system with a minimal cognitive load, but all while still allowing a dev the ability to override anything on a micro or instance-only level. Enter Typescript!</p></div><h2 id="why-learn-vueventus" tabindex="-1">Why Learn VueVentus? <a class="header-anchor" href="#why-learn-vueventus" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>There is a learning curve to be able to fully customize the visual aesthetics of a modern web application through VueVentus&#39;s abstractions.</p><p>However, a major reason for these abstractions, is to make rapid prototyping efficient/logical for devs and iteratively fast/flexible for designers.</p><p>The complexity and learning curve only applies to the need to make surgical component-level edits or global component-wide edits well into the production process for:</p><ul><li>Major Design changes</li><li>Last Minute Feature call-outs</li><li>Accessibility and Fire Drill updates</li><li>Branding</li><li>Full Re-designs</li><li>Legal call-outs</li></ul><p>VueVentus handles these normally expensive/arduous issues in stride - and incredibly quickly with practice. The trick lies in leveraging the system&#39;s centralization of the overall landscape of atomic string patterns that occur in any given web app.</p><blockquote><p>This centralization allows designers to make sweeping changes to the &quot;feel&quot; of the app&#39;s tones in both dark and light mode contexts... but completely abstracted away from the code that designers just don&#39;t like to deal with. With VueVentus this is all centralized, and thanks to Tailwind CSS, it&#39;s also human readable! \u{1F609}</p></blockquote><p>VueVentus aims to <strong>empower</strong> designers to work closer to the code and repository workflows, and <strong>reward</strong> devs with a vernacular consistency that designers don&#39;t need to change, because it&#39;s already grouped into vernacular that designers understand.</p><blockquote><p>And thanks to Typescript/JavaScript and VueVentus modules, all of this can be peeked into, overridden and type-checked on both global and instance-only scales.</p></blockquote><p>Basically, VueVentus starts as an initial static data store for rapid prototyping, and then incrementally overridden into a structural blueprint for DRYness, alongside that prototype&#39;s transformation into a production app.</p><p>The payoff is easy and fast sweeping changes, even late in the game, and a pattern that scales across different app code bases easily. All together, this leads to incredibly DRY and efficiently re-designable apps and components. \u{1F60D}</p><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">TIP</p><p>Over time, VueVentus defaults should be replaced as needed by a custom configuration file (or files) that follow the <a href="/vueventus/modules/configs/vv-config.html">VvConfig</a> structure.</p><p>In most cases, an app&#39;s custom configs are merged with VueVentus defaults at app start.
