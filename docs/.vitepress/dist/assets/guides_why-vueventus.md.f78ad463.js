It is designed to weave the advantages of Tailwind CSS into the natural flow and DX of modern Vue.js app development.</p><p>This position and the abstractions provide modular and component focused management of the many different types of repeated strings that happen when using atomic CSS classes.</p><p>And for the initiated, even static global JavaScript primitives that occur in everyday app development can be easily added to a VueVentus global config payload.

The trick lies in leveraging the system&#39;s centralization of the overall landscape of atomic string patterns that occur in any given web app, and sticking with it.</p><blockquote><p>This centralization allows designers to make sweeping changes to the &quot;feel&quot; of the app&#39;s tones in both dark and light mode contexts... but completely abstracted away from the code that designers just don&#39;t like to deal with. With VueVentus this is all centralized, and thanks to Tailwind CSS, it&#39;s also human readable! üòâ</p></blockquote><h2 id="project-mission" tabindex="-1">Project Mission <a class="header-anchor" href="#project-mission" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Project Mission&quot;">‚Äã</a></h2><p>VueVentus aims to:</p><ol><li><strong>Empower</strong> designers to work closer to the code and repository workflows</li><li><strong>Provide</strong> developers with full access to component and data properties giving devs the control they need to override, extend/type-check, and customize on both global and instance levels.</li><li><strong>Invite</strong> production teams to enjoy a truly modular system allowing both devs and designers to iterate, create and mix-and-match the visual characteristics of web app components to make endlessly unique web experiences</li><li><strong>Create</strong> a consistent and systemic vernacular that designers and developers can both logically infer to serve as a bridge between the silos of design and front end engineering through a strategically DRY styling management system</li></ol><p>To accomplish this, VueVentus starts as an initial static data store for rapid prototyping. After that, teams can incrementally override the <a href="/vueventus/modules/configs/vv-config.html">VvConfig</a> object to taste as that same prototype matures into a production app.</p><p>The payoff is easy and fast sweeping styling changes, even late in the game, and a pattern that scales across different app code bases easily.
