CLI installed components pass along VueVentus core functionalities via component props, so you can fully customize each prop default and applied classes resulting from default and component instance values, by overriding VvConfig defaults in your app `./src/app.vv.ts` file.

From there, you can extend, combine, and leverage the VueVentus styling management patterns as needed for your project-specific components, interfaces and content!
