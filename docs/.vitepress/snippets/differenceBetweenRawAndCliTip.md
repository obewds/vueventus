:::warning CLI or Raw?
The main difference between raw library components and CLI installed components, is you have no control over component defaults with raw library components. This is less flexible than CLI installed components, because control of component defaults can reduce the number of props a dev has to type with component instances, and reduce code. 

Meanwhile, the control CLI installed components provide with customizable defaults, provides a global level of styling control via component default values (particularly powerful with color and size characteristics).
