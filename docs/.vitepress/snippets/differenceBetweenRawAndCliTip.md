:::warning CLI or Raw?
The main difference between raw library components and CLI installed components, is that you have no control over component defaults with raw library components. This is less flexible than using CLI installed components, because control of component defaults can greatly reduce the number of props a dev has to type for component instances, which reduces app code. 

Meanwhile, the control CLI installed components provide through customizable defaults, opens up to a global level (styling management system) control for default component state characteristic values (particularly powerful with color and proportional size characteristics).
