::: warning
You may have to click this component a couple of times as VitePress's awesome template (used to make these docs) has it's own dark/light mode functionality and they both kinda work together because they both add/remove a `.dark` class from the app!

That said, if you click these example elements a few times, then they will take over the page from VitePress!
