title: Validator Modules

# {{ $frontmatter.title }}

The VueVentus component system comes with a variety of component prop {{ $frontmatter.title }} for use within the Vue.js component prop validation system.

These modules are used to allow a single source of truth between library components - so the end developer experience provides developers with Vue's awesome prop warning feedback.

::: tip DESIGNER FRIENDLY
An added bonus of the {{ $frontmatter.title }} approach: web app and accessibility designers can also access and read these app constraints since these modules are abstracted into focused files that are more approachable for non-devs compared to application code!
