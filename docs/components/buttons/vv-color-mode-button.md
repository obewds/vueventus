# {{ $frontmatter.title }}

The {{ $frontmatter.title }} provides a `localStorage()` based solution to quickly implement and manage a user's dark or light color mode setting (with optional unnoticable faux-persistence) for a VueVentus powered application.





## Import

```javascript
import { VvColorModeButton } from '@obewds/vueventus'
```
