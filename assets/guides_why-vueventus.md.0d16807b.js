It is designed to sit <strong>around</strong> the Tailwind CSS functionalities of an app and <strong>between</strong> the CSS and JavaScript functionalities (and DX \u270A) of Vue.js.</p><p>This position and these abstractions provide modular and component focused management of the many different types of repeated strings and JavaScript primitives that occur in everyday app development.</p><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">TIP</p><p>VueVentus is highly opinionated from a programmatic POV. But from a design POV, VueVentus is intensely customizable and powerful, because it uses hardcore programmatic DRY approaches under the hood.</p></div><h2 id="why-learn-vueventus" tabindex="-1">Why Learn VueVentus? <a class="header-anchor" href="#why-learn-vueventus" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>There is a learning curve to be able to fully customize the visual aesthetics of a modern web application through VueVentus&#39;s abstractions.</p><p>However, a major reason for these abstractions, is to make rapid prototyping efficient/logical for devs and iteratively fast/flexible for designers.</p><p>The compliexity and learning curve only applies to the need to make surgical component-level edits or global component-wide edits well into the production process for:</p><ul><li>Design changes</li><li>Feature callouts</li><li>Accessibility updates</li><li>Branding reasons</li><li>Re-designs</li><li>Legal callouts</li></ul><p>In the end, VueVentus acts as an initial data store for rapid prototyping, and a structural blueprint for DRYness in production apps built with atomic classes.</p><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">TIP</p><p>Over time, VueVentus defaults should be replaced as needed by a custom configuration file (or files) that follow the <a href="/vueventus/modules/vv-config.html">VvConfig</a> structure.</p><p>In most cases, an app&#39;s custom configs are merged with VueVentus defaults at app start. In the case of Vue.js v3, the merged config data should then use the <code>provide()</code>/<code>inject()</code> pattern to pass the merged data down to app layouts, components and modules.</p></div>',17),i=[n];function r(l,u,d,c,p,h){return t(),a("div",null,i)}var g=e(o,[["render",r]]);export{f as __pageData,g as default};
